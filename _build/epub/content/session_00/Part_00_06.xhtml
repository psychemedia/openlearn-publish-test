<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>This free course provided an introduction to studying aquatic mammals. You have now learned about a variety of aquatic mammals, their behaviours and their evolutionary history. The final section then introduced the ways in which humans have impacted the ecosystem.</p>
<p>The course activities were designed to help you to improve your confidence as an independent learner, and develop your approach to study and learning at a distance.</p>
