    "One useful (and surprisingly underused) tool to check what you’ve written is typing it on a word processor and (after setting the language to your target language) using the spelling and grammar tools to check the text. The software may provide suggestions for changes which you will need to consider (as text processors can get things wrong too). This is not cheating, it’s a useful way to learn from any mistakes you have made.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another useful tool is to input your text into a translation tool. If the translation fits what you wanted to say you can infer that, although it may not be perfect, it communicates what you wanted to write. It is tempting to use a translation tool for composing the text in the first place. The problem is that you wouldn’t be engaging with the task of writing text, just checking the translation, and being able to start composing a text from scratch is a necessary skill in your language learning process.\n",
    "\n",
    "More advanced learners can follow the process of expanding their writing by checking their use of vocabulary and looking at their sentences and how they link with one another, for example."
