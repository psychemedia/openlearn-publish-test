# 12 Summary of Week 1


This week you have looked at your motivation, some of the barriers you might come across when learning a language, and strategies to deal with them. You might have started setting yourself some SMART goals, using the CEFR as a map.

You should now be able to:

* visualise your ‘future language self’ and set SMART goals

* think about how realistic your aims are, map your journey and consider how long it will take

* understand possible barriers to your success and how to deal with them.

Before you go any further, reflect on the following: what does learning a language actually involve?

Next week, Olly will talk you though this question, drawing on his experience of learning languages.

You can now go to Week 2.
