    "An important special case of non-uniform motion along a line is that which arises when an object is subjected to constant acceleration. This kind of motion is called __uniformly accelerated motion__. An object falling under gravity near to the surface of the Earth, such as the apple of <a xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" href=\"\">Figure 24</a>, provides an approximate realisation of such motion. (Air resistance, which increases with speed, prevents the acceleration from being truly constant in such cases.) A more precise realisation of uniformly accelerated motion is provided by an object falling under gravity close to the surface of an airless body such as the Moon (see Figure 38) or by a falling object in an evacuated (i.e. airless) drop-tower or drop-shaft of the kind discussed in Section 1 of this course."

For example, it is often the case that we want to know the displacement from the initial position after some specified period of constant acceleration, rather than the final position *x*. In such circumstances it is useful to subtract *x*﻿<sub xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\">0</sub> from both sides of <a xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" href=\"\">Equation 22</a> and use the definition *s﻿<sub xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\">x</sub>﻿* = *x* − *x*﻿<sub xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\">0</sub> to write the resulting equation as\n",

The basic idea is that the drop-vehicle should be launched from the bottom of the tower with just the right velocity to enable it to reach the top of the tower with zero velocity. If the vehicle is uniformly accelerated over the first 10 m to give it the necessary upward velocity it can then rise freely for the remaining 130 m, pass through its highest point, and fall freely for another 130 m before being brought to rest over the final 10 m of its descent. Using a coordinate system in which the upward direction is positive, answer the following questions.\n",
