    "This free course, *How to learn a language*, is for anyone thinking of learning a language. Whether it is the first time you are venturing into language learning, or if you have already started, this course will show you how to keep motivated, set your own goals, and develop strategies to learn a language. You will understand what is needed to succeed, and get lots of advice on how to develop the four skills of speaking, listening, reading and writing. You will also find out how to learn vocabulary, and how to evaluate language learning resources. Finally, you will also learn how to create a ‘virtual language immersion’ for yourself.\n",
    "\n",
    "The course lasts 8 weeks, with approximately 3 hours of study time each week. You can work through the course at your own pace, so if you have more time one week there is no problem with pushing on to complete another week’s study. You can also take as long as you want to complete it.\n",
    "\n",
    "After completing this course, you will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* understand your motivation for learning languages\n",
    "\n",
    "* set realistic goals in language learning\n",
    "\n",
    "* memorise vocabulary\n",
    "\n",
    "* evaluate independent language learning resources for personal learning goals\n",
    "\n",
    "* create a virtual immersion environment."

Badges are a great motivation, helping you to reach the end of the course. Gaining a badge often boosts confidence in the skills and abilities that underpin successful study. So, completing this course should encourage you to think about taking other courses."
