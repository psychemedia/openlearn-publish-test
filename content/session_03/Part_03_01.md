So far, you have looked at motivation, setting realistic goals, and hopefully also gained a better understanding of what it means to learn a language. This week I will show you ways to find useful resources to support your language learning and present a framework to evaluate the resources you find according to your own individual learning needs.

By the end of this week, you should be able to:

* find resources for learning languages

* understand the different sorts of resources you can use

* choose and evaluate resources for language learning.
