# Introduction


This week of the course is written by Olly Richards.

Last week, you looked at the first of the four language skills, speaking. When asked why they are learning a language, most people say ‘because I want to speak it’. Although speaking is an important skill, for me listening is the key skill, and this week I will show you why, and guide you through core study skills to develop your listening.

By the end of this week, you will be able to:

* understand what is involved in listening

* find out about the difference between intensive and extensive listening

* understand the different types of authentic and graded audio, and look for audio resources for yourself.
