# 11 Summary of Week 4


You should now be able to:

* understand what is involved in speaking

* understand different ways to practise speaking on your own and with others

* understand different activities that you can do to practise your speaking skills.

Next week, Olly will talk about listening which, as youâ€™ve seen this week, is the other side of the coin.

You can now go to Week 5.
