    "Metabolism is the technical name given to the sum of all the chemical transformations inside cells. Many such changes involve building up complex chemicals from simpler building blocks – for example, the proteins and fats for lactation that were described earlier. In animals, the energy that such ‘building-up’ processes require comes from the process of breaking down foodstuffs – the progressive breaking down in our bodies of the complex macromolecules that comprise our diet. The chemical reactions that take place in an animal are affected by temperature. The adaptations that enable a mammal to regulate body temperature form a key mammalian feature – the ability to maintain body temperature using internal body heat."

Heat energy liberated during metabolism enables mammals to maintain a stable body temperature and occupy habitats where the external temperature may vary over a large range.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reptiles get much of their energy directly from the sun as warmth, but when the sunlight fades at dusk the body temperature of a reptile falls and it becomes sluggish, lacking the energy to move. Very early in their history, mammals developed the remarkable ability to generate heat within their bodies by driving their metabolism at a much higher rate. As a consequence, it was necessary to feed more often in order to supply the extra fuel needed to maintain the high body temperature. Physiological processes that limited heat loss evolved."

Thus the arctic fox which you met in the introduction (Figure 1) remains warm and active in very cold conditions. But being warm-blooded has a high energetic cost. In mammals, as much as 80-90% of the energy obtained from their food is needed to maintain body temperature.\n"

    "The distinction between ‘warm and cold blooded’ animals is a shorthand that is useful in distinguishing between mammals and other animals, but it does not apply universally. Non-mammals can generate body heat, for example a python and some species of fish, such as tuna. A reptile basking in the sun can become as warm to the touch as a mammal and its lethal temperature may be higher than that of many mammals. If you’ve encountered a mammal during hibernation – perhaps a cautious investigation of a hedgehog – you’ll probably have found it surprisingly cold to the touch. So in describing what’s special about the body temperature of mammals, cold-blooded and warm-blooded are terms best avoided."

    " The chemical transformations that contribute to metabolism depend ultimately on the uptake of oxygen by the animal.

In this process, usable energy is released, along with some heat.\n",

    "Measuring how much oxygen is consumed by an animal over a period of time, such as a minute or an hour, is a pretty good measure of the intensity of metabolism (i.e. the metabolic rate). But when measuring and comparing oxygen consumption in two animals that are very different in size – say a mouse and an elephant – all you learn is that overall, an elephant consumes much more oxygen over a minute than a mouse does. This is simply because a massive elephant has so many more cells in which metabolism is whirring away. If your interest is in metabolic rate, you need to take size differences into account by calculating the volume of oxygen consumed for a particular amount (or mass) of animal.\n",

    "Volumes of a gas such as oxygen would be measured in millilitres (ml), or the numerically equivalent unit, cubic centimetres (cm<sup xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\">3</sup>). The mass of the animal would be measured in grams (g), or perhaps in thousandths of a gram, i.e. milligrams (mg). In practical terms, oxygen consumption by a mouse of known mass would be measured over a period of time, say 15 minutes, and the values recalculated as so many ‘cubic centimetres of oxygen per gram of mouse per hour’.

    "How then do mammals raise their metabolic rate in the ways shown in Figure 20? Some behavioural tactics will probably be familiar to you. Increasing activity – e.g. the stamping of feet – reflects an increase in voluntary muscular activity; since the muscles are working harder, they produce more metabolic heat.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another part of the explanation is shivering, where opposing sets of muscles contract in a high frequency mode. Rather than movement resulting – the usual effect of muscle contraction – these ‘inefficient’ tiny contractions produce large amounts of heat. Shivering can be temporarily blocked by drugs (notably curare, which prevents muscle contraction) but when such drugs are applied, they don’t entirely remove the ability that animals have to increase metabolism in the cold. This suggests that there’s another component at work in such responses. It’s now known that many mammalian tissues (such as the liver of species used to living in the cold) have the capacity to raise their metabolism and burn off more fuel in the mitochondria. There is a range of circumstances when ‘turning on’ heat production in this way is especially advantageous, which can’t be explored in this course. But from a brief look at mammals well-suited to life in the cold, what’s striking is that they don’t just have visible ‘on the surface’ adaptations, such as thick fur. They can display ‘inner’ adaptations – in their metabolism, for example – of the type that only measurements such as those in Figure 20 can reveal."

    "Spreading saliva onto the forelimbs achieves much the same effect as sweating; the evaporation of the fluid requires heat that comes from the skin surface. The effect is to cool the skin and the blood flowing through adjacent vessels. The flow of blood through and near the skin (i.e. the peripheral circulation) often increases, thereby augmenting the effect.\n",
    "\n",
    "Behaviour plays an important part in promoting heat loss amongst animals that live in hot, dry environments. As you’ve just seen, shade seeking is one familiar example; wallowing in cooling mud is another. Echidnas live in some of the hottest environments on Earth, with temperatures often approaching 40 °C, and appropriate behaviour is crucial to their survival. No laboratory measurements (as seen in Figure 19) could do justice to the subtle and diverse ways in which these animals cope with heat or cold ‘in the field’. In the past, largely on the basis of laboratory studies, echidnas were thought to lack any physiological cooling mechanism. For them, a body temperature of above 38 °C is fatal, because it is at least 6 °C above their normal body temperature. In hot weather, echidnas become entirely nocturnal. They spend their days in caves or burrows, where temperatures are significantly cooler than outside, so their bodies can lose heat to their surroundings. But they also rest in hollowed-out logs where the inside temperature is seldom lower than that outside. The fact that body temperatures appear to stay reasonably constant (seldom more than 35 °C) in such very hot conditions suggests that echidnas may indeed have some physiological means of adjusting temperature, which may well include increasing peripheral circulation. Remaining inactive in such conditions helps reduce the amount of heat the animal produces internally. But echidnas may go one step further and actively reduce their rate of metabolism, entering a profoundly inactive state called torpor. Much the same device is used by echidnas to cope with cold conditions, though here their prolonged inactivity (two to three weeks) and their highly suppressed metabolism (20% of the normal resting value) is more like true hibernation, with *T*<sub xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\">b</sub> as low as 5 °C.\n",
    "\n",
    "These findings have come from close observation in the field and, if confirmed by other scientists, they would be further evidence that echidnas are not at all primitive and physiologically inept; they have sophisticated control mechanisms in place. Much the same is true of marsupials, though they generally have a lower *T*<sub xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\">b</sub> and BMR than the placental mammals do. But far from being a primitive feature, this subtle metabolic adaptation may reduce the food requirement and ensure that food reserves last for longer during adverse conditions.\n"
