If you drop an apple it will fall downwards, but it will pick up speed as it does so (Figure 24), and if you drive along a straight road you are likely to encounter some traffic that will force you to vary your speed from time to time.

As you can see, the position-time graph is curved. There is relatively little change in position during the first few seconds of the motion but as the velocity increases the car is able to change its position by increasingly large amounts over a given interval of time. This is shown by the increasing steepness of the graph. In everyday language we would say that the graph has an increasing gradient, but you saw in the last section that the term gradient has a precise technical meaning in the context of straight-line graphs.

    "Extending the concept of gradient to the case of curved graphs is actually quite straightforward. The crucial point to recognise is that if you look closely enough at a small part of a smooth curve, then it generally becomes indistinguishable from a straight line. (In a similar way, the surface of the Earth is clearly curved when viewed from space, but each region is approximately flat when seen close-up.) So, if we choose a point on a curve we can usually draw a straight line passing through that point which has the same slope as the curve at the point of contact. This straight line is said to be the __tangent__ to the curve at the point in question. Now, we already know how to determine the gradient of a straight line, so we can define the gradient at any point on a curve to be the gradient of the tangent to the curve at that point, provided the curve is sufficiently smooth that a tangent exists.\n",

If you had some time left, you might go on to measure the gradient of the velocity-time graph at various times, and then plot the acceleration-time graph for the motion. This would effectively complete the description of the motion, but it would be enormously time consuming and, given the difficulty of reading graphs, not particularly accurate.\n",

Table 6 lists a few of the basic derivatives along with the simplest of the rules for combining them - it also gives some explicit examples of functions and their derivatives. Computer packages are now available that implement the rules of differentiation, these are often used to determine the derivatives of more complicated functions (Figure 32)."

    "The idea of a derivative may be new to you and, if so, may seem rather strange. However, if you know the explicit form of a function, then there are several crucial advantages in using derivatives to determine gradients, rather than making measurements on a graph. In particular, looking up the derivative of a function in a table should be completely accurate, whereas measuring the gradient of the tangent to a graph is always approximate. For example, if *f*﻿(*y*﻿) = *y*﻿<sup xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\">2</sup> then the derivative of *f*﻿(﻿*y*﻿) is d﻿*f*﻿/﻿d﻿*y* = 2*y* and evaluating the derivative at *y* = 3 to find the gradient at that particular value of *y* gives 6. This is an *exact* result that could not have been obtained with such precision from measurements on a graph. Moreover, if we want to know the gradient at many different values of *y*, all we need to do is to substitute each of those values into the general expression for the derivative, d*f*/d*y* = 2*y*. This is much simpler than drawing many different tangents and measuring their individual gradients."

    "Now, in the context of non-uniform motion, it seems natural to ask if the same interpretation can be given to the area under a general velocity-time graph, such as that between *t*<sub xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\">1</sub> and *t*<sub xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\">2</sub> in Figure 33. The answer to this is a definite yes, though a rigorous proof is beyond the scope of this course, so what follows is simply a plausibility argument.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Figure 33, the colour-shaded area under the graph does not take the shape of a rectangle. However, it may be approximately represented by a sum of rectangular areas, as indicated in Figure 34. To produce Figure 34 we have broken the time between *t*<sub xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\">1</sub> and *t*<sub xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\">2</sub> into a number of small intervals, each of identical duration Δ*t* and within each small interval, the velocity has been approximated by a constant, which can be taken to be the average velocity during that interval. As a result, the area of each rectangular strip in Figure 34 represents the approximate change of position over a short time Δ*t* and the sum of those areas represents the approximate change of position over the interval *t*<sub xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\">1</sub> to *t*<sub xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\">2</sub>. Now, if we were to repeat this process while using a smaller value for Δ*t*, as in Figure 35, then we would have more strips between *t*<sub xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\">1</sub> and *t*<sub xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\">2</sub>; their total area, representing the approximate change in position between *t*<sub xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\">1</sub> and *t*<sub xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\">2</sub>, would be an even closer approximation to the true area shown in Figure 33. Given these results, it seems reasonable to suppose that if we allowed Δ*t* to become smaller and smaller, while the number of rectangular strips between *t*<sub xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\">1</sub> and *t*<sub xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\">2</sub> became correspondingly larger and larger, then we would eventually find that the area under the graph in Figure 33 was *exactly* equal to the change in position between *t*<sub xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\">1</sub> and *t*<sub xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\">2</sub>."

    "This conclusion is in fact correct and can be proved in a rigorous way by considering what mathematicians call a *limit*, in this case 'the limit as Δ*t* tends to zero'. We shall not pursue that here, but we should note that it wasn't until the early nineteenth century that the mathematics of limits was properly formulated, although it was in use long before then. It is also worth pointing out that it was the development of the idea of a limit that finally laid Zeno's paradox to rest. Just as the increasing number of diminishing strips can have a finite total area, so the increasing number of smaller steps that Achilles must take to reach the tortoise can have a finite sum and be completed in a finite time. Rigorous mathematical reasoning agrees with our everyday experience in telling us that motion can exist and that athletes outrun tortoises!"
