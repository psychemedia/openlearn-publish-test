    "Everyday experience teaches us that unconfined objects are free to move in three independent directions. I can move my hand up or down, left or right, backwards or forwards. By combining movements in these three directions I can, at least in principle, move my hand to any point in space. The fact that there are just three independent directions, and that these suffice to reach any point, shows that the space in which my hand moves is __three-dimensional__.\n",

    "Treating a real object, such as an aeroplane, as though it is a particle is clearly a simplification. Real objects certainly do have size, shape and internal structure, but such details can often be neglected in specific contexts. Making simplifications of this kind is an important part of the skill of scientific modelling in physics. A good __model__ uses the well-defined concepts of physics to represent the essential features of a problem while omitting the irrelevant details. The trick is not to oversimplify. The model should be as simple as it can be, but no simpler. Just what this entails will depend on the problem being analysed. For example, the use of the year as a unit of time is a result of the orbital motion of the Earth around the Sun. This orbital motion is described quite easily while treating the Earth as a particle. The Earth's diameter is about 10 000 times smaller than the distance between the Earth and the Sun, so a particle model is a very good approximation in this case. However, a particle model of the Earth cannot account for the distinction between day and night since that depends on the rotation of the Earth.\n",

Taken together, the posts constitute an __axis__ of the system; a straight line along which distances can be measured. One point on the axis must be chosen as the __origin__ and assigned the value 0. Points on one side of the origin can then be labelled by their distance from the origin (10 m or 20 m say), while points on the other side are labelled by *minus* their distance from the origin (−10 m or −20 m for example). Conventionally, we might represent any of these values by the algebraic symbol *x*, in which case it would be called the *x*-coordinate of the corresponding point on the axis, and the axis itself would be called the *x*-axis.\n",

Thus for example −﻿10 is larger than −﻿20, and so if you subtract −﻿20 from −﻿10 you get −﻿10 − (﻿−﻿20﻿) = 10, a positive number. At the time illustrated the car is at *x* = 30 m, and a pedestrian (also modelled as a particle) is at *x* = −20 m. Notice that it is essential to include the units in the specification of *x*. It makes no sense to refer to the position of the car as being '30', with no mention of the units, i.e. metres. In one dimension, the specification of a physical __position__*x* consists of a positive or negative number multiplied by an appropriate unit, in this case the metre."

However, in describing real motions it is often important to know where something is located relative to a point other than the origin. Figure 10 shows a case in point; in a high-speed pursuit neither the police nor the robbers are likely to be very interested in their location relative to the origin, but both will be interested in the location of their own vehicle relative to the other. The physical quantity used to describe the location of one point relative to another is called __displacement__. In the case of Figure 10, the displacement of the getaway car from the police car is 400 m and the displacement of the police car from the getaway car is −400 m. In each case the displacement of a body is determined by subtracting the position coordinate of the reference body from the position coordinate of the body of interest. Thus the displacement (measured along the *x*-axis) of a particle with position *x* from a chosen reference point with position *x*<sub xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\">ref</sub> is given by"

    "Notice that displacements, like positions, may be positive or negative depending on the direction of the displacement. Thus *s<sub xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\">x</sub>* is always positive when *x* is to the right of *x*<sub xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\">ref</sub> and is negative when *x* is to the left of *x*<sub xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\">ref</sub>. Also note that since displacements are measured along a definite axis it makes sense to represent them by a symbol, *s<sub xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\">x</sub>*, that includes a reference to that axis. This symbol may be read as '*s* subscript *x*' or, more simply, as '﻿*s* sub *x*﻿'.\n",

Then *x*<sub xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\">ref</sub> = 0 and *s<sub xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\">x</sub>* = *x*. Thus the displacement of a point from the origin is the position coordinate of the point. Once we know the displacement *s<sub xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\">x</sub>* of one object from another, it is easy to work out the __distance__*s* between those two objects. The distance is just the numerical value of the displacement, including the unit of measurement but ignoring any overall negative sign. So, when the displacement of the police car from the getaway car is *s<sub xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\">x</sub>* = −400 m, the distance between them is *s* = 400 m. We describe this simple relationship between distance and displacement by saying that the distance between two objects is given by the __magnitude__ of the displacement of one from the other, and we indicate it mathematically by writing"
