    "Do you own a smartphone? [An OfCom report from 2015](https://www.ofcom.org.uk/about-ofcom/latest/media/media-releases/2015/cmr-uk-2015) declared that the UK is ‘a smartphone society’ and 66 per cent of adults owned one. This is not a statistic that refers to the UK alone: in the USA, smartphone ownership is estimated at 68 per cent and a similar picture appears in many other developed countries."

    "Smartphones are an excellent tool to immerse yourself in a language when you’re not living in an area where your target language is spoken. There are a number of tools that come with most smartphones that can aid the language learning process. These include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* language settings (these can be changed so that menus and options,voice-controlled personal assistants like Siri and OK Google and apps you have installed, will be in the target language)\n",
    "\n",
    "* web browsers, which offer access to language learning web resources\n",
    "\n",
    "* multilingual text input (dictionary, grammar and auto-correct features can be set to the target language)\n",
    "\n",
    "* speech-to-text tools, which can act as tools for testing pronunciation and to check spelling\n",
    "\n",
    "* communication tools such as email/messaging/telephone/video conferencing, which can provide opportunities for synchronous or asynchronous communication among learners, teacher-student, or with native speakers\n",
    "\n",
    "* the photo/video camera, which provide possibilities for creating content that can be the basis of or illustrate communicative exchanges\n",
    "\n",
    "* satellite navigators (if the language setting has been changed, directions will be provided in the target language).\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, app stores such as iTunes and Google Play carry a myriad of apps that can be installed in your smartphone. In Week 3 we presented a classification of language-learning resources that divided them into those that are designed for language learning, those that are designed primarily for native speakers and dictionaries/translators. Here we use the same classification to suggest some apps that you may find useful."

    "The most popular apps for language learning are DuoLingo and Busuu. Others include LingQ, Mango, Speakeasy and Babbel to name but some. These apps provide activities to develop several skills as well as vocabulary and grammar. They offer opportunities to spend a few minutes every day reinforcing what you may have learnt elsewhere or indeed teach you new vocabulary and grammar, with plenty of opportunities to practise and memorise what you’ve learned.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Other language-learning apps focus on separate skills. If you search within your app store, you will find apps that provide grammar exercises, reading comprehension activities, help with writing (particularly useful for languages that have a different type of script to your first language) or pronunciation, for example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Flashcard apps such as Anki, Duolingo Tinycards and Quizzlet provide an excellent way to help you memorise vocabulary. If you search the card sets that other users have uploaded you will probably find sets for the language you’re learning, often organised by level or topic. Remember that, as Tita explained in Week 6, you can also make your own cards, and that this will help you not only focus on the vocabulary that you find useful, but also making the cards will help you encode the vocabulary into your long-term memory."

You can also buy or rent music and films, often with subtitles in the target language at least.\n",

Games can also be played in the target language (traditional games such as Scrabble or Hangman, or more current ones like Clash of Clans)."

    "Although apps can provide an excellent opportunity to immerse yourself in the language, they can also be a distraction. Think carefully about how much time you want to spend on the types of activity they offer and make sure that they aren’t stopping you from dedicating your time to other language learning activities that might be more useful to you at that particular stage in your language learning. Also, apps in your own language may prevent you from immersing yourself in the language when you visit an area where your target language is spoken. Many English students, for example, use apps that provide access to TV content in their own language while they’re abroad, or read the news from home. While they’re doing that, they aren’t watching TV in the language they’re learning.\n"
