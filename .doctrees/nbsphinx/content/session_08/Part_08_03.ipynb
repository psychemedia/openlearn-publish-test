    "\n",
    "* __Social networks:__ Wherever people hang out, communities form. Facebook is the world’s largest social network, and there are many Facebook groups for language learners. Reddit is another source of in-depth language information.*__Tip:__ If you are a Facebook user, head to Facebook, and search ‘learn [language]’ in the search bar. Select Groups from the options tab.*\n",
    "\n",
    "* __Forums:__ Forums are less popular than they once were. However, there are still many forums run by private individuals who are passionate about promoting language learning or specific languages. In forums, you will often find many of the most dedicated learners of specific languages, who will be able to answer your most challenging questions and point you in the way of good resources. Popular forums include [UniLang](http://forum.unilang.org/) and [How to learn any language](http://how-to-learn-any-language.com/e/index.html). __*Tip:*__* Do an online search: ‘learn [language] + forum’*.\n",
    "\n",
    "* __Language company forums:__ Many of the larger online language companies have their own communities, which can be a great source of information and support. You may also find additional features, such as the ability for native speakers to correct or comment on things you write. Two of my favourites are [iTalki](https://www.italki.com/) and [Lang-8](http://lang-8.com/)."

From novice learners documenting their journey with a new language, to expert language learners sharing their best advice and language material, it’s fair to say you can find literally anything among the world’s language learning blogs.\n",

Podcasts fulfil the same purpose, with audio. If you prefer listening to reading, you may find more fulfilment from a podcast.\n",

Beyond the obvious benefits of language practice, meeting people with similar interests can be hugely motivating, and can lead to friendships and opportunities that make all the difference in your success with languages.\n",

Searching Facebook or Google for ‘language exchange’ or ‘meetup’, and including a language and location, can uncover hidden gems. For example, try searching: ‘Japanese language meetup London’."
