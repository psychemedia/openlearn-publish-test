    "You’ve just seen that there are an estimated 250,000 distinct words in English. Imagine you were learning English as a new language from scratch; if you wanted to learn even half the words in the language and set yourself the rather tall order of learning ten new words a day, it would take you over 30 years to achieve it. So what’s going on?\n",
    "\n",
    "Well, although there are an estimated 250,000 distinct words in English, a conservative estimate of how many words a well-educated native speaker knows suggest the figure is somewhere between 20,000 to 27,000 word-families (Goulden, Nation and Read, 1990; Zechmeister et al., 1995). Well, learning vocabulary at the same rate as before, that would take over 7 years – although remember that learning 10 new words a day, day in, day out, is a tall order, but 7 years seems more manageable, and if you studied intensively, or were able to immerse yourself in the language, it might be achievable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another way to estimate how many words a learner might need is to figure out the number of words needed to do what they would like or need to do in the language, such as dealing with spoken language when you go on holiday, reading newspapers or watching TV. Here, the research shows that a small number of word types occurs very frequently and makes up most of the words in spoken or written text. The table below show how the most frequent 1000 word families account for over three-quarters of the words in text. The next two frequency bands (so a vocabulary of 3000 word families) account for nearly 90 per cent of the words in these texts and then the effect decreases, so increasing your vocabulary beyond that makes very little difference to the texts you can understand.\n",
