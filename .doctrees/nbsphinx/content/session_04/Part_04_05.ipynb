    "The __bitwise operators__``&amp;`` (and) and ``|`` (or) are used in pandas to build more complicated expressions from two comparison expressions (typically involving column comparisons).\n",

    "\n",
    "A __Comma Separated Values (CSV)__ file is a plain text file that is used to hold tabular data.\n",
    "\n",
    "A __list__ is a sequence of values, separated by commas, and written within square brackets.\n",

    "There are six __comparison operators__ that can be used to compare number, string and date values. Expressions composed of these operators evaluate to ``True`` or ``False``. These operators can also be used to compare every value in a column, row by row, against some number, string or date value. When used in this manner the operators return a series of Boolean values.\n",

    "### Functions and methods\n",
    "\n",
    "``asType(aType)`` when applied to a dataframe column, the method changes the data type of each value in that column to the type given by the string ``aType``.\n",
    "\n",
    "``datetime(yyyy, mm, dd)`` the function takes three arguments, ``yyyy`` a four digit integer representing a year, ``mm`` a two digit integer representing a month and ``dd`` a two digit integer representing a day. From these arguments the function creates and returns a value of ``datetime64``.\n",
    "\n",
    "``dropna()`` when applied to a dataframe returns a new dataframe without the rows that have at least one missing value.\n",
    "\n",
    "``head()`` gets and displays the first five rows of a dataframe. Optionally the method can take an integer argument to specify how many rows (from and including row 0) to get and display.\n",
    "\n",
    "``iloc[index]`` gets and displays the row in the dataframe indicated by the integer argument ``index``.\n",
    "\n",
    "``isnull()`` is a series method that checks which rows in that series have a missing value.\n",
    "\n",
    "``fillna(value)`` is a series method that returns a new series in which all missing values have been filled with the given value.\n",
    "\n",
    "``plot()`` when applied to a dataframe column of numeric values, the method displays a graph of those values. The x-axis shows the dataframe’s index and the y-axis the range of the column’s values. Before the method is called you first need to execute ``%matplotlib inline``.\n",
    "\n",
    "``read_csv(csvFile)`` creates a dataframe from the dataset in the CSV file.\n",
    "\n",
    "``rename(columns={oldName : newName})`` renames the column ``oldName`` to ``newName``.\n",
    "\n",
    "``str.rstrip(suffix)`` when applied to a dataframe column of string values, the method removes the argument ``suffix`` from the end of each string value in the column.\n",
    "\n",
    "``tail()`` gets and displays the last five rows of a dataframe. Optionally the method can take an integer argument to specify how many rows (until and including the last row) to get and display.\n",
    "\n",
    "``to_datetime(aSeries)`` when applied to a series, typically a column from a dataframe, this function returns a new series in which each value in ``aSeries`` has been changed to type ``datetime64``."
