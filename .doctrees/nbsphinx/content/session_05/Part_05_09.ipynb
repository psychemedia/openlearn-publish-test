    "Go online and search for listening resources in your target language. You might want to specify your level in the search terms you use, so search for instance for ‘Spanish listening practice for beginners’ or ‘German listening exercises B1’.\n",

    "You will need to evaluate the resources you find, so don’t forget about the framework that Fernando introduced you to in Week 3.\n",

    "\n",
    "* Listening: does the resource provide audio in the target language?\n",
    "\n",
    "* Pronunciation and intonation: does the resource offer specific activities for pronunciation and intonation?\n",
    "\n",
    "* Language varieties: does the resource include different regional or national varieties of the language? "
