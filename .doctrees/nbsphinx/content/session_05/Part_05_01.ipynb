    "Last week, you looked at the first of the four language skills, speaking. When asked why they are learning a language, most people say ‘because I want to speak it’. Although speaking is an important skill, for me listening is the key skill, and this week I will show you why, and guide you through core study skills to develop your listening.\n",
