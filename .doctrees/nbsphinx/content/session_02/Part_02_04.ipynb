    "An __assignment__ is a statement of the form ``variable = expression`` . It evaluates the expression and stores its value in the variable. The variable is created if it doesn’t exist. Each assignment is written on its own line.\n",
    "\n",
    "__CamelCase__ is a naming style in which names made of various words have each word capitalized, except possibly the first.\n",
    "\n",
    "A __comment__ is a note about the code. It starts with the hash sign (#) and goes until the end of the line.\n",
    "\n",
    "A __dataframe__ is the pandas representation of a table.\n",
    "\n",
    "An __expression__ is a fragment of code that can be __evaluated__ , i.e. that has a value, like a variable name.\n",
    "\n",
    "A __file not found__ error occurs if the computer can’t find the given file, e.g. because the name is misspelled or because it’s in another folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "A __function__ takes zero or more __arguments__ (values) and __returns__ (produces) a value.\n",
    "\n",
    "A __function call__ is an expression of the form ``functionName(argument1, argument2, …).``\n",
    "\n",
    "An __import statement__ of the form ``from module import`` * loads all the code from the given module.\n",
    "\n",
    "The __maximum__ and __minimum__ of a set of values is the largest and smallest value, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "The __mean__ of a set of numbers is the sum of those numbers divided by how many there are.\n",
    "\n",
    "The __median__ of a set of numbers is the number in the middle, i.e. half of the numbers are below the median and half are above.\n",
    "\n",
    "A __method__ is a function that can only be called in a certain context, like a dataframe or a column.\n",
    "\n",
    "A __method call__ is an expression of the form ``context.methodName(argument1, argument2, ...).``\n",
    "\n",
    "A __module__ is a package of various pieces of code that can be used individually.\n",
    "\n",
    "A __name__ is a case-sensitive sequence of letters, digits and underscores. Names cannot start with a digit. Function, variable and module names usually start with lowercase.\n",
    "\n",
    "A __name error__ occurs if the computer doesn’t recognize a name, e.g. if it was misspelled.\n",
    "\n",
    "An __operator__ is a symbol that represents some operation on one or two expressions, e.g. the four basic arithmetic operators.\n",
    "\n",
    "The __range__ of a set of values is the difference between the maximum and the minimum.\n",
    "\n",
    "A __reserved__ word cannot be used as a name. Jupyter shows reserved words in green boldface.\n",
    "\n",
    "A __statement__ is a command for the computer to do something, e.g. to assign a value or to import some code.\n",
    "\n",
    "A __string__ is a verbatim piece of text, surrounded by quotes. Jupyter shows strings in red.\n",
    "\n",
    "A __syntax error__ occurs if the computer can’t understand the code because it is not in the expected form, e.g. if a reserved word is used instead of a name or some punctuation is missing.\n",
    "\n",
    "A __variable__ is a named storage for values."
