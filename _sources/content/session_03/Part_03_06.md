# 5 Evaluation activity


In the following activity you will evaluate an app used for language learning.


### Activity 2 Evaluating a resource 
__Timing: Allow about an hour__


#### Question

If you have a smartphone or tablet, download a free app that offers language-learning courses, such as Duolingo or busuu from your app store (or check for something else you like the look of under the Education &gt; Learn a new language category in your app store). Spend 20–30 minutes trying out the different features it provides and then consider the questions below. If you do not have access to a smartphone or tablet or would rather evaluate another resource, perhaps one that you use regularly or a free resource you’ve found online, then do so.

Score a mark from 0 to 5 for each question, or N/A if the criterion is not applicable to your resource

How did the resource score? Did going through the questions help you to think about what the resource offers and lacks? Spend 5 to 10 minutes writing a short reflection about how engaging with the questions may be useful or not when you next consider a resource.




### Laura says:

One of the things I think is important when I choose an app is what criteria are the most important for me at the time, so which ones I will prioritise above others. For instance, the gamification aspect is fun, but the stability of the app is much more important.
