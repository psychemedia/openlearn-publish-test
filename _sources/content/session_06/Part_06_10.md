# 9 Summary of Week 6


I hope this week has given you lots of ideas about how to learn vocabulary â€“ and some understanding of how your memory works! In Weeks 4 and 5 we looked at speaking and listening. 

Next week Fernando will talk you through the two other language skills of reading and writing. 

You can now go to Week 7.
